In their own words,\nIf you’re familiar with the older Ingress API, you can think of the Gateway API as analogous to a more-expressive next-generation version of that API.\nIn this article we’ll quickly review the role-oriented architecture of the Gateway API before we implement it using Cilium and Cert-manager. Other Gateway API implementations are listed on the Gateway SIG site.\nWe’ll mainly take a look at replacing Ingress resources for traffic from clients outside the cluster to services inside the cluster ( north/south traffic). Although the Gateway API also supports so-called east/west traffic between workloads within a cluster (through the GAMMA-initiative), this is outside the scope of this article.\nBefore reading this article you might want to try a hands-on lab on Cilium Gateway API by Isovalent, the company behind Cilium.\nEating my own dog food this blog is now delivered through the Gateway configuration explained here. Overview # In the role-oriented design of the Gateway API, the infrastructure provider provisions a GatewayClass which the cluster operators can use to create different Gateway resources for consumption by the application developers using HTTPRoutes connecting to plain old Services.\nComparing this with the Ingress API we see that the Ingress resource has been split into the Gateway and HTTPRoute objects with different responsibilities.\nGateway API # Kubernetes 1.28 doesn’t ship with the Gateway API CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), we therefore need to manually apply them ourselves.\nThe latest Gateway API release can be found in their GitHub repository under releases. We’re interested in trying out some of the experimental features (the GatewayInfrastructure), so we’ll apply the experimental installation by running\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/experimental-install.yaml This effectively enables the Gateway API, and we can start using it.\nCilium # Cilium already has a page on Migrating from Ingress to Gateway in their documentation, gearing up to fully support Gateway API v1.0.0 in Cilium v1.15.0.\nThis article is mostly written using Cilium v1.14.5 which passes conformance tests for Gateway API v0.7.1, though I did not run in to any issues using core functionality for Gateway API v1.0.0.\nFollowing the documentation of Cilium we can enable Gateway support in one of two ways, either with the Cilium-CLI ( ≥ v0.15)\ncilium install \u0026ndash;version 1.14.5 \u0026ndash;set kubeProxyReplacement=true \u0026ndash;set gatewayAPI.enabled=true or using the Helm Chart as described in the summary section.\nCert-manager # Gateway API support is an experimental feature in the latest stable release of Cert-manager at the time of writing (v1.13.3). To enable this support we add the \u0026ndash;feature-gates=ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport=true flag on startup of Cert-manager. This is done by setting it as an extra argument when installing Cert-manager using its Helm Chart\nhelm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io helm repo update helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \u0026ndash;version v1.13.3 \u0026ndash;namespace cert-manager \u0026ndash;set installCRDs=true \u0026ndash;create-namespace \u0026ndash;set \u0026ldquo;extraArgs={\u0026ndash;feature-gates=ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport=true}\u0026rdquo;\nConfiguration # Once we have the Gateway API CRDs available and enabled support for it in Cilium and Cert-manager we can finally start to create the resources we need to utilise it.\nInfrastructure provider # If a cluster wide GatewayClass resource referencing Cilium is not already present (kubectl get gatewayclasses) we need to create one ourselves1\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: GatewayClass metadata: name: cilium spec: controllerName: io.cilium/gateway-controller Take note of the GatewayClass name (line 4) and make sure of the controllerName on line 6.\nIf the GatewayClass is created successfully you should be able to view the supported features by running\nkubectl describe gatewayclass cilium Cluster operator\n# For convenience, we’ll group the cluster operator related resources in the gateway namespace. This allows us an easy overview of our gateways and connected resources as cluster operators.\nkubectl create ns gateway TLS certificates (Cloudflare)\n# To automatically provision TLS certificates attached to our Gateway we can create a Cert-manager Issuer resource. This section is optional if you don’t need certificates, though I highly recommend it!\nFor details on how to automatically provision wildcard certificates using Cert-manager and Let’s Encrypt I’ve summarised the process in a previous article on Traefik Wildcard Certificates, so I’ll allow myself to be brief here.\nObtain a Cloudflare API token (or from you supported DNS provider of choice) as mentioned in the above article and create a Secret for it\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: cloudflare-api-token namespace: gateway type: Opaque stringData: api-token: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026ndash;CLOUDFLARE API TOKEN\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; We can then reference this secret in an Issuer resource (line 16) which enables us to complete a DNS-01 challenge that allows us to issue wildcard certificates for the proven domain. Remember to provide the domain owner e-mail on line 9.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: Issuer metadata: name: cloudflare-issuer namespace: gateway spec: acme: server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory email: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026ndash;YOUR EMAIL\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; privateKeySecretRef: name: cloudflare-key solvers: - dns01: cloudflare: apiTokenSecretRef: name: cloudflare-api-token key: api-token Gateway\n# Next we create a Gateway resources that references the cilium GatewayClass (line 9). The annotation on line 7 is picked up by Cert-manager to automatically issue certificates from the cloudflare-issuer Issuer and create a TLS-Secret with the name with provided on line 18 when all goes well.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Gateway metadata: name: cilium-gateway namespace: gateway annotations: cert-manager.io/issuer: cloudflare-issuer spec: gatewayClassName: cilium listeners: - protocol: HTTPS port: 443 name: https-gateway hostname: \u0026ldquo;*.\u0026lt;\u0026ndash;YOUR DOMAIN\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; tls: certificateRefs: - kind: Secret name: cloudflare-cert allowedRoutes: namespaces: from: All We need to create at least one listener per Gateway that listens for e.g. HTTPRoute resources that matches. In our case we’ve created an HTTPS-listener on port 443 that matches all subdomains. The tls-field is picked up by Cert-manager which will create a TLS-secret with the given name when an HTTPRoute is attached. We allow eligible HTTPRoutes from all namespaces to connect through this Gateway, but we can also create a selector for more fine-grained control.\nGateway Service\n# Cilium 1.15.0 released on 2024-01-31 and fully supports the Gateway infrastructure annotation discussed below. A LoadBalancer Service is created when the Gateway is picked up by the Cilium controller. As of Cilium 1.14.5 there appears to be no methods to directly manipulate the spawned Service from the Gateway to e.g. annotate it for requesting a specific IP address.\nI strive for an idempotent configuration for my homelab and thus prefer static IPs for my LoadBalancer Services. Running Cilium LB-IPAM a way to do this is by annotating the Service with io.cilium/lb-ipam-ips: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026ndash;IP\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;.\nAt first, I hoped that annotating the Gateway may propagate to the Service. I was apparently not the first to think this might work according to a closed GitHub issue which states Gateway annotation propagation will not be implemented.\nIn a thread on Reddit u/nuskovg points to the GatewayAddress field used by the GatewaySpec as a possible solution. The support for this field is extended, and u/TheGarbInC mentions an open GitHub issue for Cilium support which is yet undecided.\nDigging deeper, u/h_hover can inform of an experimental GatewayInfrastructure field and a closed GitHub issue cautiously promising support in Cilium 1.15.\nThis then led me to optimistically try Cilium 1.15.0-rc.0 and add\ninfrastructure: annotations: io.cilium/lb-ipam-ips: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026ndash;IP\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; in my Gateway spec… And it works! The Gateway Service now has the requested annotation, and we have a deterministic configuration!\nDNS\n# Now that you’ve got your Gateway and attached LoadBalancer Service set up you want to point you DNS to the Service IP. This IP address should be the same as what you set in the Gateway infrastructure annotation field (io.cilium/lb-ipam-ips), but to make sure you can run\nkubectl get svc -A | grep LoadBalancer and find the External IP of the Service named \u0026lt;GatewayClass.name\u0026gt;-gateway-\u0026lt;Gateway.name\u0026gt;, in our case cilium-gateway-cilium-gateway.2\nOpen up port 443 in your router or firewall to the Service IP and point you DNS to your public IP. If you don’t have your public IP at hand you can find it by running\ndig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com If everything is set up correctly, an external web request should roughly take the following path:\nWeb DNS Router Service Gateway First the hostname is looked up in a DNS. The DNS should respond with the IP you set up, and the request is relayed to your router. Next the router port forwards the request to the Service IP connected to the Gateway. The Gateway then presents the attached certificate and the journey continues.\nGateway HTTPRoute ɑ Service Pod/Application HTTPRoute β HTTPRoute γ From the Gateway the request is channeled to the correct HTTPRoute – route ɑ in this case, based on the rules you’ve set up, e.g. hostname or header-matching. Next, the HTTPRoute directs the request to its attached Service, which then finally delivers the request to its destination. Hopefully the application responds with something nice.\nIf you don’t want to expose your public IP, you can instead use a service like cloudflared to tunnel traffic directly to your cluster. If you want to go this route you can find an example configuration here.\nApplication developer\n# Now that both the infrastructure provider and cluster operator have done their job (kudos to you!), we can let the application developers (also you) take the centre stage.\nGiven a Service named my-service we can easily create a simpleHTTPRoute referencing our Gateway (line 7) and the Service (line 17) to expose the Service\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: HTTPRoute metadata: name: my-http-route spec: parentRefs: - name: cilium-gateway namespace: gateway hostnames: - \u0026ldquo;gateway.\u0026lt;\u0026ndash;YOUR DOMAIN\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; rules: - matches: - path: type: PathPrefix value: / backendRefs: - name: my-service port: 80 HTTPRoutes also allows developers to easily do header based routing for canary deployments, or traffic splitting for blue-green testing.\nI strongly encourage you to take a look all the capabilities on the Gateway API user guide for more ideas.\nSummary\n# I’m running Argo CD with Kustomize + Helm in an attempt to follow GitOps best-practices.
