Hi, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve always had a curious min and enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts, this led me to get picked up by Edgeworks (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´) where I currently work as a DevOps consultant engaged at Statens pensjonskasse.

Coming from a background in physics I kind of stumbled into the world of IT, though I feel right at home with the problem-solving opportunities and open-minded culture Iâ€™m now part of.
